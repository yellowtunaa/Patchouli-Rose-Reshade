# Patchouli-Rose-Reshade-Preset
Patchouli Rose ReShade from intramoon on Tumblr.

PRESET INFORMATION 

𝄖  Preset is for Reshade version 3.0.8

𝄖  In order to use the background blur disable edge smoothing, please! I’ve created two options for Bokeh lookin’ backgrounds: MartyMcFly DOF and Matso DOF.

𝄖  Blur focus is controlled with your mouse!

𝄖  In tab mode the MXAO decreases significantly so you’ll see it’s harsh in live mode but don’t worry! It will look subtle and more cohesive in tab mode.

!!! DOES NOT WORK IN PERFORMANCE MODE !!!
